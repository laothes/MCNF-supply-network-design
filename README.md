This is a group project to solve an MCNF question using pulp and networks at NTU's course MH6202, 2024.

We choose [supply_network_design](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Gurobi/modeling-examples/blob/master/supply_network_design/supply_network_design_1.ipynb) as our object of study to explore the difference in using pulp and networkx - python packages.
